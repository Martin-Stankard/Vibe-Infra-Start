# Vibe-Infra-Start
Near term goal is to get this to a point of changing itself with user choose a,b,c d type ui (probably pop-ups driven from Jenkins, the orderly agent action framework caller :)
Some kind of quickstart jsdoc setup, that is served to / fed / looped into / rag'd into an ollama llm, out to llm "do stuff command line" server. Also some kind test tracker frame work. Cheesy dev support gimmicky tools. "Docker Compose Up"

Stage 1 will be: 

- backend probably a mongo db client for a minute, then a node app with at least tabbed excel views of the db.
-- always wanted to make an all in db, web components single page app... 
- frontend?
-- On load event, hit db and spa away...?
-- home roll react lite?
-- graphql? tasty with mongo and my wtf idk where this is going flow.
- ollama
- mongodb 
- ~~jsdoc...maybe come back, AND will be hitting everything with jsdoc parameters no matter what~~
- ~~jenkins~~


- ~~maybe a sqlite db for jenkins + rag (then a qdrant vector db and flowise/wildcat python rag just does a "folder of pdf's/.txt's preferrable" AND/OR .... THIS. jsdocs... .)~~
- some other node server to act as ollama's hands? Not now with Jenkins. middleware to sequential calls in jenkins~~
- ~~possibly a rag ....idk without flowise atm....but should hit that db for jenkins sql db and another vec qdrant db...can't beat that flowise rag io.~~
 - pickle unit test famework, looking for use cases. 2.0 after the old junkins is humming.
- ALL out to elkstack >> rag/llm?


Limit this file to a basic list of docker containers. Note writing NEEDS to be in JSDoc flavor.
