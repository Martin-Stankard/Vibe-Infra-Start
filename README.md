# Vibe-Infra-Start
Some kind of quickstart jsdoc setup, that is served to / fed / looped into / rag'd into an ollama llm, out to llm "do stuff command line" server. Also some kind test tracker frame work. Cheesy dev support gimmicky tools. "Docker Compose Up"

Stage 1 will be: 
jsdoc
jenkins
ollama
maybe a db for jenkins
some other node server to act as ollama's hands..middleware to sequential calls in jenkins..
possibly a rag ....idk without flowise atm....but should hit that db for jenkins sql db and another vec qdrant db...can't beat that flowise rag io.
possible pickle unit test famework, looking for use cases.
